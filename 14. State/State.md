The state pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

+ **Intent:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
+ **Purpose:**
	+ Encapsulate state-specific behavior.
	+ Simplify complex state transitions.
	+ Improve code organization and maintainability.
	+ Eliminate large conditional statements based on state.
+ **How it Works:** 
	+ The state pattern defines an interface for all concrete state classes.
	+ Concrete state classes implement the state interface and provide specific implementations of the state-dependent behavior.
	+ The context clas holds a reference to a state object and delegates state-dependent behavior to it.
	+ State transitions are typically handled by the state objects themselves or by the context.

# When to Use the State Pattern

+ **Object Behavior Depends on State:** When an object's behavior changes based on its internal state.
+ **Complex State Transitions:** When you have complex state transitions that are difficult to manage with conditional statements.
+ **State-Specific Behavior:** When you have state-specific behavior that needs to be encapsulated.
