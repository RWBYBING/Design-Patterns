# Software Design Principles

+ In software development, these principles guide the creation of maintainable, flexible and robust code. A prominent set is the **SOLID** principles:
	+ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
		+ A class should have only one reason to change.
	+ **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
		+ Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	+ **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
		+ Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
	+ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
		+ Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
	+ **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
		+ High-level modules should not be forced to depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.

# The Relationship with Design Patterns

+ Design patterns are practical implementations of these software design principles. They provide reusable solutions to common software design problems.
+ By employing design patterns, we aim to achieve:
	+ **Maintainability:** Easier code modifications and updates.
	+ **Flexibility:** Adaptability to changing requirements.
	+ **Reusability:** Application of proven solutions in various contexts.kk
