The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's useful when you need to control the instantiation of a class and ensure that only one object of that class exists throughout the application.

# Key Characteristics

+ **Single Instance:** Only one instance of the class can be created.
+ **Global Access:** Provides a global point of access to that instance.
+ **Controlled Instantiation:** The class itself controls its instantiation.

# Use Cases

+ Logging: A single logging instance can be used throughout the application.
+ Configuration Managers: A single configuration manager can provide access to application settings.
+ Database Connections: A single database connection instance can be used to manage database access.
+ Thread Pools: Managing a single thread pool.
