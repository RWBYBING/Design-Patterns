The Builder pattern is another powerful creational pattern that addresses the complexities of object construction, especially when dealing with objects that have many optional or configurable components.

+ **Intent:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
+ **Purpose:** 
	+ Simplify the creation of complex objects with many optional parameters or configurations.
	+ Improve code readability and maintainability by separating the construction logic from the object's representation.
	+ Allow the same construction process to be used to create different representation of the object.
+ **How it Works:**
	+ A "builder" class defines an interface for building the different parts of the object.
	+ Concrete builder classes implement the builder interface and provide specific implementations for constructing each partã€‚
	+ A "director" class orchestrates the construction process using the builder interface.
	+ The client code interacts with the director to build the object.

# When to Use the Builder Pattern

+ **Complex Object Construction:** When you have objects with many optional or configurable components.
+ **Different Representations:** When you need to create different representations of the same object using the same construction process.
+ **Step-by-Step Constructions:** When the construction process involves multiple steps that need to be performed in a specific order.
